# Graphite

graphite offers the infrastructure as well as the expertise to enhance your publications for a multi-media and interactive digital context. The more than ever emerging demand for reliable and well-edited information meets a depreciated way of publishing. To bridge this gap our portfolio ranges from individualised consulting to services in each steps of a publication process – from a draft to its launch.
