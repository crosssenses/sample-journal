# LRN LAB

We connect worlds and people! Coming from the background of a large corporate energy company, we reinvented ourselves as the Learn Lab (LRN LAB). As a start-up we embark on our own learning journey to deal with the complexity of the digital era. Our mission is to support companies and people with the digital transformation. Learning to cope with uncertainty, in our opinion, is one of the main strengths and capabilities in this fast-changing world. As LRN LAB we experiment with new approaches in our own team and turn our experiences into products and new formats. Customers appreciate our approach, which may be based on enquiry and at other times may give them guidance and structure. When creating solutions, we can draw from our experience as a start-up, as well as from the group transformation of RWE and Innogy.<br><br>Although we cannot predict the future, we are convinced that we need robust theories to make future-oriented decisions. Our interdisciplinary team of agile coaches, systemic change consultants, trainers, e-learning experts, and trend analysts can facilitate both major digital transformations and smaller-scale trainings for Design Thinking or Agile Leadership. In this context, we implement the perspective of systemic metatheory, by offering an alternative to plan-based linear thinking and taking into account the systemic complexity of companies and their environment. Change begins with the recognition that change itself is not just another corporate target, but rather the endeavour to deconstruct one’s own patterns in dealing with the environment. In this process, a new future opens up almost automatically.
