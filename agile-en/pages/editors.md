# LRN LAB

We connect worlds! Coming from the background of a major energy group, we reinvented ourselves as the Digital Lab and are now on the move as a start-up. Our mission is the digital transformation. Customers appreciate our approach, which may be based on enquiry and at other times may give them guidance. In creating solutions, we can draw on our experience as a start-up, resulting from the Group transformation of RWE and Innogy. 

Although we cannot predict the future, we are convinced that we need robust theories to make future-oriented decisions. Our interdisciplinary team of agility coaches, systemic change consultants, trainers, e-learning experts, and trend analysts can facilitate both major digital transformations and smaller-scale training and suggestions to encourage reflection on design thinking or agile leadership. In this context, we implement the perspective of systemic metatheory, by offering an alternative to plan-based linear thinking and taking into account the systemic complexity of companies and their environment. Change begins with the recognition that change itself is not just another corporate target, but rather the endeavour to deconstruct oneâ€™s own patterns in dealing with the environment. This process leads to the almost automatic opening-up of different kinds of future.
